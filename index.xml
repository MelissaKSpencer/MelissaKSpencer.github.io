In both developed and developing countries, women are acquiring more education, marrying later, having fewer children and spending a far greater fraction of their adult lives in the labor force. While women are catching up to men in many economic outcomes, persistent differences remain, particularly in occupational distributions and earnings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Principles of Microeconomics</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/principles/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/principles/</guid><description>&lt;p>This course will introduce you to the fundamental questions, concepts, and techniques used in the study of economics. As an introduction to microeconomics, this course is focused primarily on understanding how individual economic agents (individual people, households, and businesses) make decisions. Students will gain insights into the ways that markets function, the role of government in markets, and some of the limitations of market-based analysis. Students will learn to apply economic concepts and models to discussions of current issues, and will also be introduced to the wide variety of topics that can be studied with economics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Economics of Risky Behaviors</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/riskybehaviors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/riskybehaviors/</guid><description>&lt;p>This course provides a non-technical introduction to the economics of risky behaviors, including
crime, alcohol and drug use, risky sexual behavior, and risky health behaviors. Students will learn
basic economic concepts and gain insight into the wide range of topics that can be studied with
a degree in economics. This course is ideal for introductory level students who are considering a
major or minor in economics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intermediate Microeconomics</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/intermicro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/intermicro/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this course you will learn to use economic models to analyze consumer and producer
choices. Intermediate Microeconomics is a core course for the Economics major. My goal
in this course is to prepare you for 4000-level economics courses by teaching you to use
the standard tools of economic analysis. As such, this course is skills-based: the best way
to succeed and prepare for exams is to solve practice problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Abortion Ballot Measures</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dobbs-voting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dobbs-voting/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, Democratic candidates lost fewer than predicted seats and stymied an expected red wave. News coverage and polling data represent this surprise Democratic success as a result of voters’ response to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. Using county-level vote data, we find that the decrease in Republican vote margin in 2022 can be explained by demographic and economic factors. However, relative to the national average, the Republican vote margin decreased by 4.8 percentage points more in states with abortion-related ballot measures. Our results indicate that abortion ballot measures have effects on election outcomes of a magnitude large enough to determine competitive races.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Safer Sex?</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/safer-sex/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/safer-sex/</guid><description>&lt;p>Behavioral adjustments to mitigate increasing risk of STIs can increase or decrease the likelihood of pregnancy. This paper measures the effects of the arrival and spread of AIDS across U.S. cities in the 1980s and 1990s on births and abortions. I show that the AIDS epidemic increased the birth rate by 0.55 percent and the abortion rate by 1.77 percent. I find support for two underlying mechanisms to explain the increase in pregnancies. Some women opted into monogamous partnerships in response to the AIDS epidemic, with a corresponding increase in the marriage rate and improvement in infant health. Others switched from prescription contraceptive methods to condoms. These behavioral changes lowered the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections, but increased both planned and unplanned pregnancies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COVID-19 and Domestic Violence in US Cities</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv-cities/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv-cities/</guid><description>&lt;p>We empirically investigate the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on domestic violence using incident-level data on both domestic-related calls for service and crime reports of domestic violence assaults from the 18 major US police departments for which both types of records are available. Although we confirm prior reports of an increase in domestic calls for service at the start of the pandemic, we find that the increase preceded mandatory shutdowns, and there was an incremental decline following the government imposition of restrictions. We also find no evidence that domestic violence crimes increased. Rather, police reports of domestic violence assaults declined significantly during the initial shutdown period. There was no significant change in intimate partner homicides during shutdown months and victimization survey reports of intimate partner violence were lower. Our results fail to support claims that shutdowns increased domestic violence and suggest caution before drawing inference or basing policy solely on data from calls to police.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Themes in Principles</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/workingpapers/themes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/workingpapers/themes/</guid><description>&lt;p>This paper describes a new, low-cost approach to increasing content relevance and student engagement in Principles of Microeconomics by organizing the class around a cohesive theme. While continuing to teach students standard introductory material, we use supplementary readings, assignments, and examples throughout the semester that are related to a specific topic. Instructors at the University of Richmond piloted themed sections for Principles of Microeconomics in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 on the topics of crime, inequality, dating, and globalization. In this paper, we provide an overview of our approach, including the institutional environment in which it was implemented, examples of how we related the themes to economic principles, and instructor and student perceptions of the benefits and difficulties of themed classes. We also provide a general framework and guidance for other instructors to use when implementing themes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Themes for Principles of Microeconomics</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/resources/resourcedocs/themes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/resources/resourcedocs/themes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Paper(coming soon) with Erik Craft and Maia Linask:&lt;br>
This paper describes a new approach to increasing content relevance and student engagement in Principles of Microeconomics by organizing the class around a cohesive theme. While continuing to teach students standard introductory material, we use supplementary readings, assignments, and examples throughout the semester that are related to a specific topic. Themed sections for Principles of Microeconomics were piloted at University of Richmond in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 on the topics of crime, inequality, dating, and globalization. In this paper, we provide an overview of our approach, including the institutional environment in which it was implemented, examples of how we related the themes to economic principles, and instructor perceptions of the benefits and difficulties of themed classes. We also share results from a survey eliciting students’ perceptions of the themes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Economics Writing Guide</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/resources/resourcedocs/writingguide/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/resources/resourcedocs/writingguide/</guid><description>&lt;p>I created this writing guide for students in my Principles of Microeconomics class. This guide is designed to help students better understand what is expected for economics writing assignments and to help them improve their writing. I plan to update this guide in Spring 2022 with an annotated sample essay.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Abortion Counseling Laws</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/inprogress/abortion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/inprogress/abortion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nearly two-thirds of states have abortion counseling laws requiring that women receive and acknowledge state-mandated information prior to giving their informed consent for abortion. The mandated information varies widely across states and may include scientifically inaccurate statements regarding the risks of abortion, illustrations of fetuses, or ultrasound requirements. Despite the ubiquity of these laws, little is known about the effect of counseling laws on women’s abortion decisions and birth rates. We compile a novel dataset of state-level abortion counseling laws and define a classification system for these laws, including fetal-focused counseling, risk-focused counseling, ultrasound requirements, and ultrasound display requirements. Using this novel dataset, we analyze the effect of abortion counseling laws on county-level birth rates. We find evidence that counseling laws affect birth rates, and show that effects are heterogeneous across type of counseling law as well as demographic groups.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gender Economics Teaching Network</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/resources/resourcedocs/teachingnetwork/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/resources/resourcedocs/teachingnetwork/</guid><description>&lt;p>This network is designed to aid instructors in preparing and teaching gender economics courses in order to give students a more diverse and research-oriented learning experience.

Some initial studies found evidence of greater DV incidence during the pandemic, but findings were inconsistent across locations and DV measures. This paper focuses on a single major city, Los Angeles (LA), to study the impact of the initial pandemic shutdown. We use three DV measures from police data (911 calls, crime incidents and arrests) as well as two measures from non-police administrative sources (the county DV hotline and hospital records). We find an increase in DV calls to the police and calls to the hotline. However, we find that DV crimes recorded by police and hospital visits by female assault (and DV) victims decreased significantly, suggesting that the increase in calls came from higher reporting rates. The decrease in DV crimes is not attributable to reductions in policing intensity, as the arrest rate for DV crimes was higher during the shutdown. We conclude that the initial LA shutdown increased the rates at which people contacted authorities about DV, but decreased the overall incidence of physical DV crimes in the population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COVID-19 and Domestic Violence in the US</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv_chapter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv_chapter/</guid><description>&lt;p>This chapter examines the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on domestic violence (DV) in the United States. Despite widespread concerns that pandemic shutdowns could increase DV, initial studies found mixed evidence that varied across data sources and locations. We review the evolving literature on the effects of the pandemic and highlight results from studies that examine multiple measures of DV across a common set of large cities. These studies show that the conflicting early results are due to opposite effects of pandemic shutdowns on two measures of DV in police data: an increase in domestic violence 911 calls and a decrease in DV crime reports. In theory, this divergence can come from either higher DV reporting rates, possibly because of additional media attention to DV and greater third-party calling, or from lower policing intensity for DV crimes. Prior evidence from police data and other sources supports the conclusion that the increase in calls came from greater reporting, while the incidence of criminal DV decreased. Finally, we present new evidence drawing on police and hospitals records from across the state of California to show that DV crimes and hospital emergency department (ED) visits were both lower during pandemic shutdowns.
