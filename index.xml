Abstract The advent of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s dramatically increased the cost of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Prior research shows that people responded to the AIDS epidemic by switching to sexual behaviors and contraceptive methods with lower likelihood of AIDS transmission. These behavioral adjustments also affect the likelihood of pregnancy and the incidence of other STIs. This paper provides evidence that the AIDS epidemic increased the birth rate among adult women by as much as 1.</description>

      <description>Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Domestic Violence in US Cities with Amalia Miller and Carmit Segal
Abstract Around the world, news outlets have reported increases in domestic violence (DV) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant restrictions on individual mobility and commercial activity. Although there are several reasons to expect that DV would increase for married and cohabiting couples, there are also forces that could reduce DV, such as COVID-19 sickness in a household or less time spent together by couples that live apart.</description>

      <description>The Effect of Tasers on Fatal Police Encounters Abstract There are over 1,000 fatal police encounters per year in the United States, and an estimated 28,000 people have died during encounters with law enforcement since the year 2000. . To decrease fatal encounters, police have sought weapons which can safely incapacitate people while they are taken into custody. One such weapon is the Conducted Energy Device (CED), better known by the brand name Taser.</description>

      <description>The Effect of Abortion Restrictions on Birth Rates, Maternal Inputs, and Infant Health with Becca Brough
Abstract In this paper we exploit variation in state-level abortion legislation to identify the effect of restrictions on maternal inputs and infant outcomes. We consider four restrictions: requirements for abortion counseling, mandated waiting periods between counseling and abortion procedures, parental involvement laws, and whether public funding for abortion is available through the stateâ€™s Medicaid program.</description>
