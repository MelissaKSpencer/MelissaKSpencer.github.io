This paper measures the empirical effects of the arrival and spread of AIDS across U.S. cities in the 1980s on births and abortions. I show that the AIDS epidemic increased the birth rate by 0.6 percent and the abortion rate by 1.5 percent for a total of at least 391,553 additional pregnancies between 1981 and 1996.</description></item></channel></rss>
