Although we confirm prior reports of an increase in domestic calls for service at the start of the pandemic, we find that the increase preceded mandatory shutdowns, and there was an incremental decline following the government imposition of restrictions.</description></item><item><title>COVID-19 and Domestic Violence in LA</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv-la/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv-la/</guid><description>From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers and news reports warned that restrictions on individual mobility and commercial activity could lead to a surge in domestic violence (DV). Some initial studies found evidence of greater DV incidence during the pandemic, but findings were inconsistent across locations and DV measures. This paper focuses on a single major city, Los Angeles (LA), to study the impact of the initial pandemic shutdown. We use three DV measures from police data (911 calls, crime incidents and arrests) as well as two measures from non-police administrative sources (the county DV hotline and hospital records).</description></item><item><title>COVID-19 and Domestic Violence in the US</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv_chapter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv_chapter/</guid><description>This chapter examines the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on domestic violence (DV) in the United States. Despite widespread concerns that pandemic shutdowns could increase DV, initial studies found mixed evidence that varied across data sources and locations. We review the evolving literature on the effects of the pandemic and highlight results from studies that examine multiple measures of DV across a common set of large cities. These studies show that the conflicting early results are due to opposite effects of pandemic shutdowns on two measures of DV in police data: an increase in domestic violence 911 calls and a decrease in DV crime reports.</description></item></channel></rss>
