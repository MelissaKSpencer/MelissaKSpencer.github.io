This paper measures the empirical effects of the arrival and spread of AIDS across U.S. cities in the 1980s on births and abortions. I show that the AIDS epidemic increased the birth rate by 0.6 percent and the abortion rate by 1.5 percent for a total of at least 391,553 additional pregnancies between 1981 and 1996.</description></item><item><title>Abortion Counseling Laws</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/inprogress/abortion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/inprogress/abortion/</guid><description>Nearly two-thirds of states have abortion counseling laws requiring that women receive and acknowledge state-mandated information prior to giving their informed consent for abortion. The mandated information varies widely across states and may include scientifically inaccurate statements regarding the risks of abortion, illustrations of fetuses, or ultrasound requirements. Despite the ubiquity of these laws, little is known about the effect of counseling laws on womenâ€™s abortion decisions and birth rates. We compile a novel dataset of state-level abortion counseling laws and define a classification system for these laws, including fetal-focused counseling, risk-focused counseling, ultrasound requirements, and ultrasound display requirements.</description></item></channel></rss>
