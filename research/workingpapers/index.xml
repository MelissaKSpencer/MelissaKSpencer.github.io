While continuing to teach students standard introductory material, we use supplementary readings, assignments, and examples throughout the semester that are related to a specific topic. Instructors at the University of Richmond piloted themed sections for Principles of Microeconomics in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 on the topics of crime, inequality, dating, and globalization. In this paper, we provide an overview of our approach, including the institutional environment in which it was implemented, examples of how we related the themes to economic principles, and instructor and student perceptions of the benefits and difficulties of themed classes. We also provide a general framework and guidance for other instructors to use when implementing themes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
