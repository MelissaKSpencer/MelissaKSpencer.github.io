This paper measures the empirical effects of the arrival and spread of AIDS across U.S. cities in the 1980s on births and abortions. I show that the AIDS epidemic increased the birth rate by 0.6 percent and the abortion rate by 1.5 percent for a total of at least 391,553 additional pregnancies between 1981 and 1996.</description></item><item><title>COVID-19 and Domestic Violence in LA</title><link>https://melissakspencer.com/research/workingpapers/dv-la/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://melissakspencer.com/research/workingpapers/dv-la/</guid><description>Around the world, policymakers and news reports have warned that domestic violence (DV) could increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant restrictions on individual mobility and commercial activity. However, both anecdotal accounts and academic research have found inconsistent effects of the pandemic on DV across measures and cities. We use highfrequency, real-time data from Los Angeles on 911 calls, crime incidents, arrests, and calls to a DV hotline to study the effects of COVID-19 shutdowns on DV.</description></item></channel></rss>
