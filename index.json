[{"categories":null,"contents":"The transformation of women’s lives in the past century is among the most significant and far-reaching social and economic phenomenon, affecting not only women, but also their partners, their children, and society as a whole. In both developed and developing countries, women are acquiring more education, marrying later, having fewer children and spending a far greater fraction of their adult lives in the labor force. While women are catching up to men in many economic outcomes, persistent differences remain, particularly in occupational distributions and earnings.\nThis course will examine economic theories and empirical evidence relating to the role of gender in the economy, with a focus on women in the workforce, family formation (marriage and children), and current issues. In taking this course, students will learn to apply economic research methods to the study of gender and to engage with cutting-edge economic research on topics such as the Me-Too movement, LGBTQ economics, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on women’s work, and women in political and corporate leadership.\n","permalink":"https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/gender/","tags":null,"title":"Gender Economics"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This course will introduce you to the fundamental questions, concepts, and techniques used in the study of economics. As an introduction to microeconomics, this course is focused primarily on understanding how individual economic agents (individual people, households, and businesses) make decisions. Students will gain insights into the ways that markets function, the role of government in markets, and some of the limitations of market-based analysis. Students will learn to apply economic concepts and models to discussions of current issues, and will also be introduced to the wide variety of topics that can be studied with economics.\n","permalink":"https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/principles/","tags":null,"title":"Principles of Microeconomics"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This course provides a non-technical introduction to the economics of risky behaviors, including crime, alcohol and drug use, risky sexual behavior, and risky health behaviors.

Intermediate Microeconomics is a core course for the Economics major. My goal in this course is to prepare you for 4000-level economics courses by teaching you to use the standard tools of economic analysis. As such, this course is skills-based: the best way to succeed and prepare for exams is to solve practice problems.\n","permalink":"https://melissakspencer.com/teaching/courses/intermicro/","tags":null,"title":"Intermediate Microeconomics"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Behavioral adjustments to mitigate increasing risk of STIs can have spillover effects that increase or decrease the likelihood of pregnancy. This paper measures the empirical effects of the arrival and spread of AIDS across U.S. cities in the 1980s on births and abortions. I show that the AIDS epidemic increased the birth rate by 0.6 percent and the abortion rate by 1.5 percent for a total of at least 391,553 additional pregnancies between 1981 and 1996. This effect is driven by women primarily using monogamy, not condoms, to protect from AIDS. These results suggest that monogamy is an important risk mitigation tool for women to avoid STIs, possibly because of women’s limited control over condom use.\n","permalink":"https://melissakspencer.com/research/workingpapers/safer-sex/","tags":["HIV/AIDS","STI","Fertility","Birthrate","Epidemic","Infectious Disease","Family Structure"],"title":"Safer Sex?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We empirically investigate the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on domestic violence using incident-level data on both domestic-related calls for service and crime reports of domestic violence assaults from the 18 major US police departments for which both types of records are available. Although we confirm prior reports of an increase in domestic calls for service at the start of the pandemic, we find that the increase preceded mandatory shutdowns, and there was an incremental decline following the government imposition of restrictions. We also find no evidence that domestic violence crimes increased. Rather, police reports of domestic violence assaults declined significantly during the initial shutdown period. There was no significant change in intimate partner homicides during shutdown months and victimization survey reports of intimate partner violence were lower. Our results fail to support claims that shutdowns increased domestic violence and suggest caution before drawing inference or basing policy solely on data from calls to police.\nMedia Coverage: Freakonomics Radio Episode 505 - Did Domestic Violence Really Spike During the Pandemic?\n","permalink":"https://melissakspencer.com/research/published/dv-cities/","tags":["COVID19","Domestic Violence","Crime"],"title":"COVID-19 and Domestic Violence"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Around the world, policymakers and news reports have warned that domestic violence (DV) could increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the attendant restrictions on individual mobility and commercial activity. However, both anecdotal accounts and academic research have found inconsistent effects of the pandemic on DV across measures and cities. We use highfrequency, real-time data from Los Angeles on 911 calls, crime incidents, arrests, and calls to a DV hotline to study the effects of COVID-19 shutdowns on DV. We find conflicting effects within that single city and even across measures from the same source. We also find varying effects between the initial shutdown period and the one following the initial re-opening. DV calls to police and to the hotline increased during the initial shutdown, but DV crimes decreased, as did arrests for those crimes. The period following re-opening showed a continued decrease in DV crimes and arrests, as well as decreases in calls to the police and to the hotline. Our results highlight the heterogeneous effects of the pandemic across DV measures and caution against relying on a single data type or source.\nMedia Coverage: IZA World of Labor - Measuring the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on domestic violence\n","permalink":"https://melissakspencer.com/research/workingpapers/dv-la/","tags":["COVID19","Domestic Violence","Crime"],"title":"COVID-19 and Domestic Violence in LA"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Nearly two-thirds of states have abortion counseling laws requiring that women receive and acknowledge state-mandated information prior to giving their informed consent for abortion. The mandated information varies widely across states and may include scientifically inaccurate statements regarding the risks of abortion, illustrations of fetuses, or ultrasound requirements. Despite the ubiquity of these laws, little is known about the effect of counseling laws on women’s abortion decisions and birth rates. We compile a novel dataset of state-level abortion counseling laws and define a classification system for these laws, including fetal-focused counseling, risk-focused counseling, ultrasound requirements, and ultrasound display requirements. Using this novel dataset, we analyze the effect of abortion counseling laws on county-level birth rates. We find evidence that counseling laws affect birth rates, and show that effects are heterogeneous across type of counseling law as well as demographic groups.\n","permalink":"https://melissakspencer.com/research/inprogress/abortion/","tags":["Health","Fertility","Abortion"],"title":"Abortion Counseling Laws"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I created this writing guide for students in my Principles of Microeconomics class.

While continuing to teach students standard introductory material, we use supplementary readings, assignments, and examples throughout the semester that are related to a specific topic. Themed sections for Principles of Microeconomics were piloted at University of Richmond in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 on the topics of crime, inequality, dating, and globalization. In this paper, we provide an overview of our approach, including the institutional environment in which it was implemented, examples of how we related the themes to economic principles, and instructor perceptions of the benefits and difficulties of themed classes. We also share results from a survey eliciting students’ perceptions of the themes.\nTheme examples:\nCrime Economics (taught by Melissa Spencer): Teaching Principles of Microeconomics with Crime Examples\nInequality and Economic Mobility (taught by Erik Craft): [Inequality Econ 101 Syllabus] (https://melissakspencer.com/InequalityEcon101.pdf)\nDating, Marriage, and Sex (taught by Maia Linask)\nGlobalization (taught by Tom Zylkin)\n","permalink":"https://melissakspencer.com/resources/resourcedocs/themes/","tags":["Teaching","Economics"],"title":"Themes for Principles of Microeconomics"}]
