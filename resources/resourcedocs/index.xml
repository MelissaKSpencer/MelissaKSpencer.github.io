There are three components, all of which are voluntary for those wishing to participate:
A Dropbox folder where instructors can share course materials, slides for research papers on gender topics, and book suggestions for gender economics courses. A Google Spreadsheet where instructors can request to be added to the email list for Zoom social hours, request to be added to the Dropbox folder, and indicate their willingness to swap lectures with other instructors.</description></item></channel></rss>
